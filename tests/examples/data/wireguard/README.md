## Handshake, Handshake reply and transport message

From the following [capture](https://github.com/Lekensteyn/wireguard-dissector/blob/master/pcaps/8-trace.pcap).

Created using the [scapy wireguard contrib packet](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/scapy.contrib.wireguard.html) because this specific packet is quite rare and we couldn't find a capture over the WEB.
