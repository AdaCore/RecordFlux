# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Open an issue on GitHub using [the vulnerability template](https://github.com/Componolit/RecordFlux/issues/new?labels=vulnerability&template=vulnerability.md). In addition to the `vulnerability` tag (which should be added automatically) also add tags for the versions that you know are affected.

We will get back to you within a working day to discuss the next steps.

## Confidential Reporting

Please report the vulnerability using a public GitHub issue as described above. Unfortunately, GitHub does not currently support private issues in public repository or any other way of reporting security vulnerabilities confidentially (cf. https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/37).

## Supported Versions

We will fix security vulnerabilities for the latest released version and the `main` branch.
