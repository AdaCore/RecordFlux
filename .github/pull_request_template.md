### Implementation

- [ ] Does this code change accomplish what it is supposed to do?
- [ ] Can this solution be simplified?
- [ ] Does this change add unwanted compile-time or run-time dependencies?
- [ ] Was a framework, API, library, service used that should not be used?
- [ ] Was a framework, API, library, service not used that could improve the solution?
- [ ] Is the code at the right abstraction level?
- [ ] Is the code modular enough?
- [ ] Would you have solved the problem in a different way that is substantially better in terms of the code’s maintainability, readability, performance, security?
- [ ] Does similar functionality already exist in the codebase? If so, why isn’t this functionality reused?
- [ ] Are there any best practices, design patterns or language-specific patterns that could substantially improve this code?

### Logic Errors and Bugs

- [ ] Can you think of any use case in which the code does not behave as intended?
- [ ] Can you think of any inputs or external events that could break the code?

### Error Handling and Logging

- [ ] Is error handling done the correct way?
- [ ] Should any logging or debugging information be added or removed?
- [ ] Are error messages user-friendly?
- [ ] Are there enough log events and are they written in a way that allows for easy debugging?
- [ ] Is the style of error / logging messages consistent?

### Dependencies

- [ ] If this change requires updates outside of the code, like updating the documentation, configuration, readme files, was this done?
- [ ] Might this change have any ramifications for other parts of the system, or backward compatibility?

### Security and Data Privacy

- [ ] Does this code open the software up for security vulnerabilities?
- [ ] Does this code change reveal some secret information like keys, passwords, or usernames (e.g., checked-in credentials)?

### Performance

- [ ] Do you think this code change will impact system performance in a negative way?
- [ ] Do you see any potential to improve the performance of the code?

### Usability

- [ ] Is the proposed solution well designed from a usability perspective?
- [ ] Is the API well documented?
- [ ] Is the API/UI intuitive to use?

### Testing

- [ ] Does it have enough automated tests (unit/integration/system tests)?
- [ ] Are there some test cases, input or edge cases that should be tested in addition?

### Readability

- [ ] Was the code easy to understand?
- [ ] Can the readability of the code be improved by smaller methods?
- [ ] Can the readability of the code be improved by different function/method or variable names?
- [ ] Is the code located in the right file/folder/package?
- [ ] Do you think certain methods should be restructured to have a more intuitive control flow?
- [ ] Is the data flow understandable?
- [ ] Are there redundant comments?
- [ ] Could some comments convey the message better?
- [ ] Would additional comments make the code more understandable?
- [ ] Could some comments be removed by making the code itself more readable?
- [ ] Is there any commented out code?

### Experts Opinion

- [ ] Do you think a specific expert, like a security expert or a usability expert, should look over the code before it can be committed?
- [ ] Will this code change impact different teams?
- [ ] Should they have a say on the change as well?
